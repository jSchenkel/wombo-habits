                We at Wombo know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <b>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that your use of Wombo’s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
              </p>
              <p><b>1.	What does this Privacy Policy cover?</b></p>
              <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
              </p>
              <p>
                As noted in the <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at <b>contact@wombo.io</b>.
              </p>
              <p><b>2.	Will Wombo ever change this Privacy Policy?</b></p>
              <p>
                We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on our website, wombo.io, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
              </p>
              <p><b>3.	What Information Does Wombo Collect?</b></p>
              <p><i>Voluntarily Disclosed Information</i></p>
              <p>
                When you use the Services, you will have the opportunity to provide us with some information directly. For example, some functions of the Services require you to register for an account, where we may ask you for your email address and password. As another example, we may also collect other information you directly give us as you build your profile on the Services, such as your name, demographic information, and phone number.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you generate User Content on our website, we will save and store that User Content for your convenience. You will be able to access, edit, and delete your User Content as set forth in Section 6, below. We will have access to all saved User Content you generate on our website in order to provide our Services to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to use our Services, you will be asked to provide certain financial information so that you can be charged for the Services that you have purchased. Please note that your financial information will be collected by a third party payment processor that we have engaged to handle our financial transactions, and we will not have access to your financial information.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at <b>contact@wombo.io</b>.

              <p>
                Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.

                We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use a service called MixPanel to help us collect and retain the information described in this section. You can opt-out of Mixpanel’s automatic retention of data collected by visiting <a href="https://mixpanel.com/optout">https://mixpanel.com/optout</a>.

              <p>
                <b>Information that’s been de-identified.</b> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so as to provide you with an optimal experience using our Services. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Affiliated Businesses:</b> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).

We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.

                <b>Business Transfers:</b> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.

              <p>
                <b>Protection of Wombo and Others:</b> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our <a href="/legal/terms">Terms of Service</a>, and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Wombo, our employees, our users, or others.
